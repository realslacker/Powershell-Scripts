A collection of my own personal powershell scripts. You may use any of these scripts in any way that is usefull to you.

* [Setup-ProfileBackup](Setup-ProfileBackup.ps1) - Moves selected folders to the target location and creates symlinks back to the source. This script is intended to be used with cloud sync providers so that specific application data folders are backed up.
